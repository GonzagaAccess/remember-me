# Remember-me

Tuesday 05-05-2020, I was notified that [my father](https://gonzagaaccess.github.io/web/about.html) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It's the biggest problem and I believe I have a duty to help him as I can.
And one of my ideas lapidated by my girlfriend (thanks Cibele) is this project.

We know that this disease is degrading and my father always needs to stimulate the brain, the conception of this project is to create an interface to remember a people _"what happened on these amazing day"_.
